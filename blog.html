<h1>Why use relative sizing(rem/em) when we can simply zoom?</h1>
<p>For starters, increasing the font size increases the text in an odd way when increased beyond a certain size making it appear deranged. Apart from making the page or text appear good-looking beforehand, manipulating the size using styling is of no particular use to end-users that is, provided the existence of the zoom feature. </p>

<h1>Modifications/Improvements That Came With CSS3</h1>
<p>To begin with, let's clear up the difference between HTML and CSS. I like to think of HTML as the main meal, while CSS as that lemon on the side(you don't do anything with it, it's just there for decorations they say). Let's think of another analogy, HTML is more of the actual girl, while CSS is the make-up. Both are two different entities, the make-up or CSS being the dependent entity- it's of no use without the girl(or boy these days) or the HTML file. They're both kept under different files, but are linked in some way.
	<br><br>
Now let's hope on to the changes that were introduced in CSS3. Shall we?
<p>1. Mobile-first mentality
CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and is equipped to handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on. This adds a whole new responsive design capability to the CSS repertoire.
<br>

2. Module-based code
One of the biggest developments is that CSS3 is split into “modules.” All of the old CSS specifications have been migrated over to the new version and divided into smaller pieces (with some new modules added as well).

Other CSS3 modules include:

Selectors: Developers can edit elements by name, class, type, attribute, and more.
The Box Model module: This describes an approach to creating consistency between HTML elements on a page, or “boxes.” By applying margins, borders, and padding to a box’s content, developers can clear area around an element, give it borders, and more.
Backgrounds and borders: With better control of the treatments of element borders and page backgrounds, CSS3 also enables rounded corners on boxes and drop shadows. Before CSS3, backgrounds had to be achieved with images, which added to a page’s file size and load time.
Text effects: CSS3 includes shadow effects, text overflow (which hides text that gets too long for its element), word breaking (automatically breaking text so it fits within a box), and text wrapping–all things that save designers lots of formatting time.
<br>
3. Web font support gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts
Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be 100 percent sure that the fonts would always display the same on everyone’s machine. Web safe fonts are fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. If a designer used common fonts like Times New Roman or Arial, they could pretty much guarantee that any user would view their site as it was intended. However, if they wanted to use a rarer font, if it wasn’t supported by a user’s machine, it would default back to a web safe font.

Designers can now run web fonts in CSS3, special fonts like those available via Google Fonts and Typecast. These fonts can either be downloaded onto a server and run through the CSS code, or accessed directly from its source via a script, which is called right within the CSS code. This has opened up a world of possibilities for designers.
<br>
4. It enables faster development, and faster load times
What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancements, which saves developers time in production. This cuts down on calls and load times for numerous images because these effects are all built into the code. Also, pages load faster thanks to overall smaller file sizes and fewer calls.
<br>
5. Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions
These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. For the first time, elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color. You can set a duration for a transition, e.g. creating a button that slowly expands and changes color when you mouse over it.
<br>
6. New colors and image effects
CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustments to opacity. Another biggie is its support of rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before.
<br>
7. Box-sizing has fixed some annoying alignment problems
Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract dimensions for padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included in the height and width.

CSS is a foundational web development technology that remains at the heart of how everything on the web looks, but with its latest evolution, it’s proving capable of so much more.

<h1>What happens when we change the default browser width? </h1>

<p>If I understand the question correctly, 16px is the default width the browser's father gave. When we, the visitors, interfere and try to change the default setting, the browser would probably say "Wait, you can't change what my father set to be." The visitor changes the size. The browser remembers when its father told it to respect the orders of its guests, so it automatically changes the width. On a serious note, by default, 1em equals 16px. Once the size is set to 200px, 1em would equal to 200px, in other words, it becomes the newly set temporary default width. </p>
